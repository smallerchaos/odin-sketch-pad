## Learnings and Reflections
Overall, this project was really straightforward. The part where you paint with opacity was challenging since I pulled the attributes (since I was setting both the background-color and opacity attributes for random color) and had to pull it apart into an array and put it back together to change the opacity. I wonder if there's a better way to do this? Also, I think I could have pulled the giant block of functionality for mouseover a pixel into its own function for clarity but I think I'm satisfied with it working for now.

Something I might want to change in the future is the behavior for when you mouse over an already colored pixel with a different brush. I think I expected the other brush to color over it but... I'm not really sure.
